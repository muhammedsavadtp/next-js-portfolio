## My Portfolio
This is a web application built with Next.js that showcases my skills, projects, and experience. It features a modern and responsive design and is easy to navigate.

## Development Process
Planning
Before starting development, I created a wireframe and a list of features I wanted to include in my portfolio. I also collected inspiration from other portfolio websites to help guide my design.

## Design
I used Figma to design the user interface for my portfolio. I followed a mobile-first approach and used a responsive design to ensure my portfolio looks great on all devices.

## Development
I used Visual Studio Code as my development environment and Git for version control. I used the following technologies and tools to develop my app:

1. Next.js
2. React
3. Tailwind CSS
4. EmailJS
5. Netlify Forms
I followed a component-based approach to development and used Tailwind CSS for styling. I also used EmailJS and Netlify Forms to create contact forms for my visitors to get in touch with me.

## Deployment
I deployed my app to Vercel using their Git integration.
